# Processing Ignite

This is an [Ignite](http://igniteshow.com/) style presentation on [Processing](http://processing.org) written in the framework itself. Slides are auto-advancing as is typical in an Ignite presentation and a slide timer is present in the lower lefthand corner. This is meant mostly as an example framework for building interactive visual presentations in Processing.


Currently one of the slides will not work on OS X due to changes in QuickTime java support.
